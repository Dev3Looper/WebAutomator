# WebAutomator
An automation programmed with Python for almost any website on web!

The idea got from [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) and [Burp Suit](https://portswigger.net/burp)

It intercept your browser traffic and captures your intraction with the website and then repeate them.

The project is under development so I would appreciate any contribution.

Feel free to email me for any questions and contribution.
